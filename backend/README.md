Ploadit Backend
===============

See the [main repo README](../README.md) for more information

The backend of this project is implemented using Node.js and SQL. Originally I wrote it in Python, but I switched over to Node.js to allow for more flexibility for the forum features on which I am currently working.

Installation
------------

Ok since I can't access the server, start by installing all necessary packages

```
npm install
```

This might take a while depending on the bandwidth to the server. Usually it shouldn't take that long. Whistle a tune.

Next, run the program! Who'd thought?

```
node app.js
```

The server should be up an running! Head on over to your nearest web browser and open it up on whichever port you specified in the environment variables. If error free, you're all good.
